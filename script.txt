Hi, My name is Millie and today I’d like to talk to you about my favourite dog, Miss. The truth is, that Miss is probably the best dog in the whole wide world. The best thing about her is how fluffy she is, and how happy she is to see me every morning. Another great thing about Miss is that she’s going to live forever, in a little cottage in the countryside with me. On another note, Misty has got some flaws, firstly, she smells sometimes, not all the time but sometimes, and she also has a tendency to be a little grumpy with other dogs. We have another dog called Ozzy, and he likes to “poke the bear” where he pokes misty repeatedly with his paw, till she growls at him, or someone intervenes before he dies.
